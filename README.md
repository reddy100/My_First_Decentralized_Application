# My_First_Decentralized_Application

Hey guys this is my first try at setting up and running a decentralized app on the Ethereum blockchain. I have borrowed the code from https://github.com/llSourcell/Your_First_Decentralized_Application 's github. 

I have previously written smart contracts but always had difficulty throwing it up onto the blockchian, this was a good exercise in picking up those skills.
